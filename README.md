# 2522 Scout 
This is a project I started to record, view, and analyse scouting data at FIRST robotics FRC events.

## Developing
There is a lot left to do. The only feature I've completed is authentication. I'm currently 
working on getting MongoDB to work with scripts on webhooks to pull data from http://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs.

## Goals
The goal of this project is for me to become more comfortable with MongoDB, AngularJS, and NodeJS.
